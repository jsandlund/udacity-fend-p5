# Questions

- Confused about what goes into the model; should this include my initliation data?
- Should I store data in the ViewModel? Should all data be stored here?
  - Currently I'm setting my ViewModel as a property of a global variable so that it's accessible elsewhere in the application. Is this OK?
- Best approach to handling multiple async calls?
